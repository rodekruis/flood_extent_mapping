# flood-extent-mapping
*Currently in development*

Docker container that runs the UN-SPIDER jupyter notebook. 

**Scope**: rough map of flood extent based on satellite imagery

**Input**: Area of Interest. Currently supported:

* GeoJSON
* KML
* KMZ
* SHP

Maximum area of 850 km^2 is recommended for quick processing. Can be increased up to 1600 km^2, but will be slower. 
*Potential solution:* If a larger area is needed, the maximum memory the SNAP software is allowed to use should be increase. See "Increasing SNAP memory".

**Output**: Flooded area, in:

* GeoTIFF
* SHP
* KML 
* GeoJSON

## File structure
Place the following files in a dedicated folder `directory_with_files`:

* `Dockerfile` used to build image
* `requirements.txt` required python packages
* `radar-based-flood-mapping.ipynb` jupyter notebook


## Requirements:

Only Docker is needed. 

## Getting started

### TLDR
1. Install Docker
2. Get a Personal Access Token that has `read:packages` for the GitHub Container repository
3. Log on to the repository: `docker login docker.pkg.github.com --username <your_user_name> --password <generated_token_not_password>`
4. Pull the docker-snap image: `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/snap-contrib/docker-snap/snap:latest`
5. Build the image `docker build  <directory_with_files> -t <choose_image_name>`
6. Run the image `docker run -it -v <directory_with_files>:/home/jovyan/flood_extent_mapping -p 8888:8888 --name <container-name> <image_name>`
7. Go to [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
8. Create a folder named 'AOI' and place 1 file in it with the area of interest (GeoJSON, SHP, KML, KMZ).
9. Run notebook. Set `tile_id` to select which satellite image to download in codeblock 4. 
10. Run the rest of the notebook. 

### Detailed instructions
 
#### 1. Install Docker

Docker Desktop installation guides are available for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) and [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) (Windows requires WSL2).

#### 2. Login to the GitHub Container registry

1. Login on github and [go to this  page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and create a personal access token with the scope *read:packages*. Copy the token somewhere. 
2. Go to your command line ('Terminal App' on a Mac, 'Powershell' on Windows) and login to the GitHub Container registry using the personal access token:
```{bash}
docker login docker.pkg.github.com --username <GitHub_username> --password <personal_access_token>
```
3. When you are logged in successfully, pull the [docker-snap](https://github.com/snap-contrib/docker-snap) image:
```{bash}
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/snap-contrib/docker-snap/snap:latest
``` 

#### 3. Create the container
Build the image:
```{bash}
docker build  <directory>  -t <choose_image_name>
```

*If  experiencing an error saying something like '... authentication failed', use this for macOS users:*
```{bash}
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0
```
*or this for Windows users:*
```{bash}
set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
set COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0
```

Run the container:
```{bash}
docker run -it -v <directory>:/home/jovyan/flood_extent_mapping -p 8888:8888 --user root --name <container-name> <image_name>
```

* `-it` interactive
* `-v` links to the volume on the local host. It may be necessary to write the path explicity, e.g.: 'C:/Users/Rosanna/floodmappingoutput'
* `-p` port
* `--user root` to allow writing access the container directory 'flood_extent_mapping'
* `--name` choose name for the container
* name of the image

The container has an entrypoint that immediately runs the jupyter notebook that has the ip address 0.0.0.0. Port 8888 is mapped to this address, so the notebook can now be accessed through [localhost:8888](localhost:8888). 

#### 4. Mapping a flood
Create a folder named 'AOI' and place 1 file in it with the area of interest (GeoJSON, SHP, KML, KMZ).
1. *User Input*: Choose a start and end date in which to search through the Copernicus Hub, and set username and password to access the Hub. 
2. *Initialization*: run
3. *Download Image*: Running this will show a map and table with available satellite images and their productID's. ProductID's are ordered as Tile1, Tile2, etc.
4. Set the `tile_id` for the image you want to download. Run the codeblock and the download (usually ~1GB) will start. The image is stored in the folder 'input'. 
5. *Processing*: the satellite image is processed. Steps 6 and 8 can cause the notebook kernel to crash if the image is too large. 
6. *Data export*: Stores the flood map as GeoTIFF, GeoJSON, KML and SHP files in a folder called 'output', and shows a geojson map of the flood extent. 

## Software required to run the jupyter-notebook
The required software is automatically installed with the Docker image, that we  based on Docker image 'docker-snap' version ?? (18-06-2021). For completeness, the following software is needed to run the jupyter-notebook (listed with known working version numbers):

* Python (version 3.9.5)
* GDAL (version 3.2.2)
* SNAP (version 8.0.0)

All python packages are installed in the conda environment 'env-snap'. GDAl is already  installed with the *docker-snap* image but not recognised as a python package, therefore it is explicitely listed in the Dockerfile.
*So far GDAL version 3.2.2 is the only version that installs without causing errors.*

### Increasing SNAP memory
Inside the docker container command line, navigate to `/srv/conda/envs/env_snap/snap/.snap/snap-python/snappy`. Open snappy.ini and increase 4G to however much your computer can handle. On windows, snappy.ini can be opened with vim :
```
vim snappy.ini
i
<edit 4G>
:w
:q
```
